# COVID-19-mortality-rate-analysis

This Tableau project visualizes global and regional COVID-19 mortality rates over time. It explores trends in case fatality ratios, comparing countries by total cases, deaths, and death rates per 100,000 people. Key visualizations include time-series graphs, choropleth maps, and bar charts to highlight the most impacted regions and demographic disparities. The dashboard enables interactive filtering by country, date range, and population metrics to support public health analysis and policy evaluation.
